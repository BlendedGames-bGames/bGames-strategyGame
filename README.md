## How to play?

This game can be played in Windows, Android and Linux; and it only requires a mouse or a touchscreen to be played. 

Your objective is to expand by day and survive by night. You can assign jobs to your citizens and create new buildings to expand your territory or collect resources.

The buildings are:

* **Capitol**: Your main base. You need to protect it from the undead just as your citizens. It lets you create more citizens.
* **Lumberjack's hut**: Used to gather **wood** and it should be placed around trees. You can order a "Cut zone" to deforest an area permanently to clear space or to obtain more wood than normal. Max 4 lumberjacks per hut.
* **Mining Camp**: Used to gather **stone**. Needs to be placed on a quarry. Max 4 miners per hut.
* **Windmill**: Used to gather **food**. Needs to be placed on meadow, free of trees. Max 4 farmers per hut.
* **House**: Used to increase town size.
* **Walls**: Used to protect your town from the undead. It also expands your citizens' **walkable area**.
* **Watchtower**: Used to defend your walls from the undead. Soldiers will be able to shoot from higher ground, increasing their accuracy and reducing the arrow's travel time.

The jobs are:
* **Soldier**: armed with bows, these soldiers can scout your surrounding area and defend your base by night.
* **Builder**: they build and repair structures.
* **Lumberjack**: they need a **Lumberjack's hut** to work. They gather **wood**.
* **Miner**: they need a **Mining Camp** to work. They gather **stone**.
* **Farmer**: they need a **Windmill** to work. They gather **food**.
